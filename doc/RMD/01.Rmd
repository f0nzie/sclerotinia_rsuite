# Creation of Table 1

Table one is one of those long, descriptive tables that requires a lot of
fiddling. The *huxtable* package makes working with these tables slightly less
of a pain in the neck. Because this table involves wrapping and the text
can get split up, I am manually copying and pasting the result into my document.

```{r load_packages, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library("readr")
library("dplyr")
library("huxtable")
```
